Introduction to the app: MediaBook is a platform to organize ideas for multimedia projects and connect with other creators. MediaBook has IdeaBoards where the user can create a board based on whatever project idea or topic they have. The user can then add and manage notes on the board to keep track of ideas for the project.  Notes can also have attached images and audio to allow users to keep track of sources of inspiration for their project. MediaBook also allows users to connect with other content creators and share ideas, tips, and give each other support through a user forum.
